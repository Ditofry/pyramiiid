In addition to the aforementioned organs, the canopic jars were associated with the four compass directions. This canopic jar depicts the baboon-headed god, Hapi—representative of the north, protector of the lungs. Hapi was a son of the god, Horus, and guarded the throne of Osiris in the underworld.";

In order to better preserve the bodies for their journeys through the afterlife, bodies were desiccated by virtue of covering them in natron (a kind of soda ash found in saline lake beds) before major organs were removed and placed into canopic jars. The heart, believed to house the soul, was left in the body. The brain was liquefied via the insertion of a rod into the cranium and left to drain through the nostrils.";

As Pharaoh, Khufu would have received the finest embalming practices of his time. Only the wealthiest citizens of ancient Egypt could afford full mummification, canopic jars, etc.";

Often depicted bearing the head of a ram, Khnum was the god of the Nile River, responsible for the annual floods which left deposits of silt and clay, thereby fertilizing arable land near the Nile. Using a great potter’s wheel, Khnum was said to have not only created the other Egyptian gods, but the bodies of human children, which he placed into their mothers’ wombs.";
